/**
 * Calendar Engine error codes.

 * 06_Backend_Architecture.md §5.2 is explicit that its table is "the single
 * canonical error-code taxonomy for the whole system." This file does not
 * fork that taxonomy — it appends the Calendar Engine's own codes to it,
 * in the same `{ code: { httpStatus, meaning } }` shape, so a future merge
 * back into that doc's table is a copy-paste, not a reconciliation.
 *
 * Every code here maps to a specific mission requirement or Deep Domain File
 * rule, cited inline.

  CALENDAR_YEAR_NOT_READY: {
    httpStatus: 422,
    meaning:
      'Cannot transition to READY/ACTIVE (or activate a semester): the full Missing/Error validation taxonomy reports at least one blocking issue, or the minimal DB-level structural backstop found a semester with no dates entered. WARNING and INFORMATION severities never block this.',

    httpStatus: 409,

    httpStatus: 409,
    meaning:
      "This fact's date is computed from an active dependency's anchor and cannot be edited directly — editing it would be silently ignored at build time, so the edit is rejected instead. Edit or remove the governing dependency.",

  },
  CALENDAR_CANDIDATE_INCOMPLETE: {
    httpStatus: 422,
    meaning:
      "Candidate's persisted timeline_days do not structurally match its academic year: wrong day count, or does not span exactly start_date..end_date. Rejected at the publish boundary before ever becoming CURRENT.",
  },
  CALENDAR_TIMELINE_DAY_YEAR_MISMATCH: {
    httpStatus: 422,
    meaning: "A timeline_days row's academic_year_id does not match its build's academic_year_id. Rejected at insert time by a database trigger, and re-verified at publish time.",
