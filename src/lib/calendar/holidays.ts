/**
 * holidays.ts — mission section 8 / Deep Domain File 2, Domain Inventory
 * items 4-5.
 *
 * Two-tier model:
 *   - FIXED:    five permanent holidays with a fixed Ethiopian month/day.
 *               Each year's occurrence date is auto-PROPOSED from that
 *               permanent rule; the admin reviews/confirms it, they never
 *               hand-type it.
 *   - MOVABLE:  four holidays (Siklet, Fasika, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha)
 *               with NO calculable date. Every single year, every single
 *               one, the admin enters the real date from the Ministry plan.
 *               This module will not calculate one under any circumstance —
 *               there is deliberately no code path that can.
