/**
 * Calendar Engine domain module — public surface.

 * Everything K2's services/API/UI layers need from the Calendar domain
 * comes through this barrel. Nothing outside `src/lib/calendar/` should
 * import a file inside it directly (except this file itself), so the
 * domain's internal organization can keep changing without breaking
 * consumers — the same discipline mission section 42 asks for between
 * Domain / Persistence / API / UI.
